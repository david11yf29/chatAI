The company says its AI memory supply is sold out through 2026 and it can meet only about 60% of near\u2011term demand, prompting capacity expansions via new plants and acquisitions. Recent results included fiscal 2025 revenue of $37.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.29, with Q1 revenue up 56.6% year over year to $13.6 billion and EPS of $4.78."
