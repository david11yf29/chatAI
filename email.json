        "news": "SanDisk Corporation's stock dropped as part of a broader pullback following a remarkable rally that saw shares surge over 1,200% since January 2025. The decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking and stretched valuations, rather than any negative shift in the company's strong fundamentals. The underlying demand for AI-driven memory remains a significant tailwind for the company, but technical indicators suggested the stock was overbought and due for a correction."

        "news": "Applied Optoelectronics Inc. (AAOI) stock plummeted approximately 18% in after-hours trading following its Q3 2025 earnings release on November 7, 2025, primarily due to revenue of $118.63 million missing analyst expectations of $122.17 million, despite non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.09 aligning with estimates. The revenue shortfall overshadowed the company's bottom-line control and strong year-over-year growth, triggering investor disappointment amid high expectations. This drop added to recent negative performance, highlighting market sensitivity to top-line misses in the fiber-optic networking sector."
