        "news": "Alibaba Group (BABA) stock slid 7.5% following its fiscal Q4 earnings release, as both adjusted earnings of 12.52 yuan per ADS and sales of 236.45 billion yuan ($32.8 billion) missed Wall Street estimates of 12.56 yuan and 239.6 billion yuan, respectively. Despite year-over-year growth in earnings (23%) and revenue (7%), the shortfall triggered the sell-off, with shares testing a key technical level before partial recovery. Cloud revenue grew 18% to 30.1 billion yuan, boosted by triple-digit AI product gains for the seventh straight quarter, though broader economic concerns in China persist."
